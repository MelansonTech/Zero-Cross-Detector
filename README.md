Project Description: Piezo Electric Buzzer with Schmitt Trigger Oscillator

This project features a Piezo Electric Buzzer Module powered by a 5V DC supply. The buzzer is driven by an oscillator circuit that uses a Schmitt Trigger Buffer to generate a stable frequency. The Schmitt trigger ensures clean, noise-resistant oscillation, improving the reliability of the buzzer's tone generation.

The module is equipped with a simple on/off control, allowing easy activation or deactivation of the buzzer. When powered, the oscillator continuously drives the piezo buzzer, emitting a consistent sound. The circuit is designed to be compact, low-power, and highly efficient, making it ideal for applications requiring simple sound signaling or alert systems.
